In the project I have used

### `yarn packages`

To install react app and other packages like `tailwind` or `react-router-dom`.
I have also install `font awesome` to add some icons
 and `google firebase authentication` to authenticate the user .
 Though I have showed registration with `email`,`google`,`facebook`,`guthub` but I have implemanted with `email-pass` and `google`.



To run  the app in the development mode.
Open [New Auth with route](https://new-auth-4d53b.firebaseapp.com/) to view it in your browser.
It has been deployed in firebase .
This is my first project which has been deployed in Firebase.

### `Steps to deploy in firebase`


1. run the command in cmd `npm install -g firebase tools` this command is needed to run only one time for the system

2. then run the command `firebase login` this caommand also needed to run only once & we have to give some permission for it.

3. Then run the command `firebase init` this command needed to run for one time for each project 

4. Then we have to build our project with the command `npm run build` , it needed to run every time i change my project 

5. Then last we have to run `firebase deploy` , it is also needed to run each time I changed the project
